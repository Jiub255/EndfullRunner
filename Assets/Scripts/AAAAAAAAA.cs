	Gameplay
	--------
	"Inverse" endless runner. The runner runs automatically and you control the obstacles. 
	When you knock one runner off/kill them, another starts. Or just an endless stream of them? 
	Control different types of guns/projectiles, trapdoors on the floor, swing poles they need to duck/jump over, etc. 
	Maybe make it so that the level ends when one of the runners make it to the end,
		the longer you keep knocking them off/killing them or whatever, the higher score you get. 
		Go from there. Could be a simple high score game, could have levels and need a certain score to pass, whatever. 
		OR, could have it so you need to knock off a certain number of runners per level. 
	Runners will need decent ai to dodge stuff. Want it to be annoyingly hard to knock them off if possible. 
	Have a camera above following the lead runner, you usually have some sort of enemy floating along backwards shooting at them or something, 
		but you can also tap on turrets/guns/whatever on the side as you pass them and they'll shoot at the runner. 
		When you knock a runner off, the camera starts following the next lead runner, or waits until another is spawned if there are none. 
	Have an SO that holds a list of transforms? Add to it as they get spawned, and remove the first/focus on the next when you knock one off. 
		Do it like a queue instead of a list?
